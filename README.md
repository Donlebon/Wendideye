# How It's Made: 

<b>Tech used: </b> HTML, CSS/SCSS, React, Firebase

This website allows users to track their purchases and attach any relevant information with them. React Router is used to navigate through each webpage and firebase as the backend database to save the user's information. 

# Lessons Learned:

I made this website because I signed up for a free trial for HBO Max to watch the Last of Us but forgot to cancel before it expired. I learned a lot about how users interact with a database and how I can make those updates according to the user's request (CRUD).
